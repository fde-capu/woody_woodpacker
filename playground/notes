Read the ELF Headers: Start by reading the ELF headers of both executables to determine their architecture, entry point, and other critical details.
Merge Segment Tables: Combine the segment tables of both executables. Each segment describes a contiguous block of memory that will be loaded into the process's address space. You'll need to adjust the virtual addresses, physical addresses, sizes, and offsets accordingly.
Adjust Section Header Table: Similar to the segment table, you may need to merge and adjust the section header table, which contains metadata about various sections like .text, .data, etc.
Modify Symbol Tables: If the executables have symbols that need to be resolved across them, you might need to edit the symbol tables to ensure they correctly reference the merged content.
Update Entry Point: Set the entry point of the combined ELF to start execution at the beginning of the first executable's code segment. After the first executable finishes executing, manually insert code to jump to the start of the second executable's code segment.
Rebuild the ELF File: After making these modifications, rebuild the ELF file with the updated headers, segment tables, section headers, and symbol tables.
